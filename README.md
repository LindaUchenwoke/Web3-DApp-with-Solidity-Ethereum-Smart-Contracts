1. I wrote a smart contract. That contract has all the logic around how the ðŸ‘‹ s are handled. This is like your server code.
2. The smart contract will be deployed to the blockchain. This way, anyone in the world will be able to access and run our smart contract (if we give them permission to do so). So, pretty much like a server :).
3. I build a client website that will let people easily interact with our smart contract on the blockchain.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
